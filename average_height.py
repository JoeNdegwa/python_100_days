"""
Write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.
e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]
The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights. e.g:
180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146
There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights
1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572
Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164
Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.
